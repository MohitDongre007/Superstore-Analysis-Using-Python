# Superstore-Analysis-Using-Python
This project analyzes Superstore sales data to uncover key insights into sales trends, Category as well as Sub-Category's Performance. Using Python libraries like Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib and Plotly. I performed data cleaning, exploratory data analysis, and interactive visualization. The analysis revealed Monthly Sales as well. I have identified top-performing product Categories, Sub-Categories by Sales. This project demonstrates my ability to analyze large datasets, generate meaningful insights, and present them through interactive visualizations.

Dataset and the project code has been shared with you all. Hope you find this helpfull and meaningfull in your journey of learning Data Analytics. Thankyou.


If in case you are not being able to see the visualizations, I advice to run codes line by line instead of running the whole code at once. Thankyou.
